In the summer of 2022, I attended the Global School of Empirical Research Methods at the University of St.Gallen. 
Here I attended a course in Deep Learning and at the end of this course I did this project. 
The task was to teach a neural network what is shown on the small pictures, e.g. pants, jackets or shoes. The course was taught at a PhD level. 

The folders contain the code and the architecture of the models.
